# Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

### What is LIRI?
LIRI is a command line Node.js application. It is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI takes in parameters, via the command line, and gives back data based on the command that is input.

### Why the project is useful
LIRI will display my latest tweets, search Spotify for information about tracks input into the command line, and can search OMDB for details about movie titles input in the command line. The app retrieves all of the data powered by the app by sendinding requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. The following Node packages were using in this application: Twitter, Spotify, and Request.
